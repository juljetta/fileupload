// With "salt round" they actually mean the cost factor. The cost factor controls how much time is needed to calculate a single BCrypt hash. The higher the cost factor, the more hashing rounds are done. Increasing the cost factor by 1 doubles the necessary time. The more time is necessary, the more difficult is brute-forcing.
// The salt is a random value, and should differ for each calculation, so the result should hardly ever be the same, even for equal passwords.
// The salt is usually included in the resulting hash-string in readable form. So with storing the hash-string you also store the salt. Have a look at this answer for more details.
